# Invisible Strings: how past and future connect in the NYC psychic business :crystal_ball:
Project 4, Lede Program 2023

This repository has data, notebooks, and HTML code for my fourth project in the Lede Program for Data Journalism at Columbia University.

## About the project
New York City has a prolific and competitive psychic business. But while many new yorkers reach out to spiritual workers looking for life-changing answers, the stories connected to these professionals remain unveiled. This project's main goal was to analyze the narratives they use to stand out online and explain the origins of their so-called gifts.

## Data
I used <a href="https://www.yelp.com/developers">Yelp API<\a> to <a href="bd_final.csv">collect information<\a> about 5-star-rated psychic readers in New York Cityâ€”their names, addresses, and business descriptions.

The data was cleaned and analyzed using the Pandas library for Python and Regular Expressions.

## Future steps
The story is just a snippet of what it can be. The business descriptions can be analyzed with natural language processing as a way to detect patterns and other elements in the texts. Interviewing the psychics is another way to delve deeper into the story.
